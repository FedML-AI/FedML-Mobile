This demo is an independent app presenting training a Logistic Regression model built with Deeplearning4J for one client
The demo assumes that all the partitioned datasets have been downloaded on the local.

Future work is to fix the communication between client and server, in order to request specific datasets from server and update model parameters to server.
For research purpose, you can refer to this demo for model building and training.
We are still developing functions on mobile to enable clients to automatically communicate with server and train model. 
The logic to achieve this can refer to our client simulator code:
